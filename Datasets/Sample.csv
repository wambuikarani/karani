My seat was broken and I had to sit uncomfortably for 6 hours
The flight departed and arrived on time
Loved the complimentary snacks—they were actually delicious
"There was zero communication during the delay, very frustrating"
"It was a typical flight, nothing stood out"
The boarding process was fast and well-organized
They lost my luggage and I had to wait two days to get it back
"The in-flight entertainment system worked fine, nothing fancy"
Friendly gate agents made the check-in process smooth
My connecting flight was canceled and no one helped me rebook
"The overhead bins were a bit full, but I found space eventually"
The cabin was clean and the seats were more spacious than expected
Flight attendants were visibly annoyed when asked for help
I had a window seat; the view was nice during descent
I was upgraded to business class without asking—amazing
I was charged extra at the gate for a carry-on that fit standard size
Security check took longer than expected but was thorough
Wi-Fi worked seamlessly throughout the flight
My tray table was dirty and hadn’t been cleaned properly
