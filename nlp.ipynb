      "at the Catholic Diocese of Nyahururu, Njabini Parish, in Kinangop, Nyandarua\n",
      "county. They faulted the President for what they described as\n",
      "misleading directives. They cited, in particular, his call for learners to report\n",
      "to Grade 10 without school fees, uniforms or adequate facilities. Democratic Party (DP) leader Justin Muturi said many\n",
      "learners remain at home despite the presidential directive, after being turned\n",
      "away by schools unable to accommodate them. “We want President Ruto to know that we are not happy. Stop\n",
      "cheating us. You are telling children to go to school even without fees and a\n",

      "transition to Grade 10 rolls out amid what he termed poor planning and\n",
      "inadequate resourcing of the education sector. He accused the government of misrepresenting the state of\n",
      "preparedness in schools and dismissed official claims that the transition had\n",
      "been fully achieved. “They are lying to us. The Principal Secretary is also lying\n",
      "that the transition to Grade 10 is 100 per cent,” he said. “That is why I am joining hands with other Kenyans in\n",
      "declaring Ruto a one-term president.” Muturi urged parents’ associations to prepare for possible\n",
      "demonstrations to pressure education officials to address the challenges,\n",
      "saying the education sector was regressing. “The vices we used to fight in education are what have come\n",
      "back. Leaders no longer care about the public,” he added. Former Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i also\n",
      "weighed in, framing the debate as a broader leadership crisis. He said the country’s problems stem from a failure of leadership\n",
      "rather than personal vendettas against those in power. “Let nobody think that we are talking because we hate them.\n",
      "The debate we have now in Kenya is about a leadership crisis,” Matiang’i said. “The leaders we have now have become a problem, and that is\n",
      "why there are many cries in the country.” Matiang’i rejected claims that the opposition lacks a plan,\n",
      "arguing that the focus should be on restoring integrity and accountability in\n",
      "governance. “Every time they say Kalonzo, Gachagua and the opposition\n",
      "have no plan. We have a plan. The first plan is to remove you,” he said,\n",
      "drawing cheers from congregants. He accused the government of allowing corruption to flourish\n",
      "and of reversing gains previously made in education and healthcare, including\n",
      "weakening public education support and the collapse of the National Hospital\n",
      "Insurance Fund (NHIF). Democracy for the Citizens Party  leader Rigathi Gachagua said opposition\n",

      "agree with,” Gachagua said. “But we must be organised as a people as we\n",
      "negotiate. The mistake we made before was going to Ruto without our own party.” The leaders also criticised the government’s labour\n",
      "migration programme, alleging that thousands of young Kenyans had been misled\n",
      "about opportunities abroad. “Ruto came and lied to us. He lied to 200,000 children and\n",
      "took them to Russia,” Gachagua claimed. “We want to tell Ruto, bring those\n",
      "children back home.” They vowed to use the ballot to hold the President\n",

Opposition hits back at Ruto over ‘insults’ and education crisis claimsThey vowed to use the ballot to hold the President accountableby JULIUS OTIENONews09 February 2026 - 09:00ADVERTISEMENTIn SummaryThe United Opposition has taken a swipe at President William Ruto, accusing him of routinely dismissing critics as “fools” and lacking empathy over the growing challenges facing learners.Opposition leaders, speaking during a church service at the Catholic Diocese of Nyahururu, Njabini Parish in Kinangop, Nyandarua County, on Sunday, faulted the President for what they termed as misleading directives.Audio By VocalizeOpposition leaders Rigathi Gachagua and Justin Muturi\\r\\nat the Catholic Diocese of Nyahururu in Nyandarua\\r\\n/HANDOUTThe United Opposition has taken aim at President William\\r\\nRuto, accusing him of routinely dismissing critics as “fools” and lacking\\r\\nempathy amid growing challenges facing learners.', 'The opposition leaders spoke on Sunday during a church service\\r\\nat the Catholic Diocese of Nyahururu, Njabini Parish, in Kinangop, Nyandarua\\r\\ncounty.', 'They faulted the President for what they described as\\r\\nmisleading directives.', 'They cited, in particular, his call for learners to report\\r\\nto Grade 10 without school fees, uniforms or adequate facilities.', 'Democratic Party (DP) leader Justin Muturi said many\\r\\nlearners remain at home despite the presidential directive, after being turned\\r\\naway by schools unable to accommodate them.', '“We want President Ruto to know that we are not happy.', 'Stop\\r\\ncheating us.', 'You are telling children to go to school even without fees and a\\r\\nuniform,” Muturi said.', '“In those schools, they need places to sleep.', 'What will that\\r\\nchild sleep on?', 'What will that child eat?”\\xa0Muturi said parents across the country are distressed as the\\r\\ntransition to Grade 10 rolls out amid what he termed poor planning and\\r\\ninadequate resourcing of the education sector.', 'He accused the government of misrepresenting the state of\\r\\npreparedness in schools and dismissed official claims that the transition had\\r\\nbeen fully achieved.', '“They are lying to us.', 'The Principal Secretary is also lying\\r\\nthat the transition to Grade 10 is 100 per cent,” he said.', '“That is why I am joining hands with other Kenyans in\\r\\ndeclaring Ruto a one-term president.”\\xa0Muturi urged parents’ associations to prepare for possible\\r\\ndemonstrations to pressure education officials to address the challenges,\\r\\nsaying the education sector was regressing.', '“The vices we used to fight in education are what have come\\r\\nback.', 'Leaders no longer care about the public,” he added.', 'Former Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i also\\r\\nweighed in, framing the debate as a broader leadership crisis.', 'He said the country’s problems stem from a failure of leadership\\r\\nrather than personal vendettas against those in power.', '“Let nobody think that we are talking because we hate them.', 'The debate we have now in Kenya is about a leadership crisis,” Matiang’i said.', '“The leaders we have now have become a problem, and that is\\r\\nwhy there are many cries in the country.”\\xa0Matiang’i rejected claims that the opposition lacks a plan,\\r\\narguing that the focus should be on restoring integrity and accountability in\\r\\ngovernance.', '“Every time they say Kalonzo, Gachagua and the opposition\\r\\nhave no plan.', 'We have a plan.', 'The first plan is to remove you,” he said,\\r\\ndrawing cheers from congregants.', 'He accused the government of allowing corruption to flourish\\r\\nand of reversing gains previously made in education and healthcare, including\\r\\nweakening public education support and the collapse of the National Hospital\\r\\nInsurance Fund (NHIF).', 'Democracy for the Citizens Party \\xa0leader Rigathi Gachagua said opposition\\r\\nleaders were open to working with like-minded partners ahead of the 2027\\r\\nGeneral Election but cautioned against repeating past political mistakes.', '“We have our own vehicle, and we shall work with anyone we\\r\\nagree with,” Gachagua said.', '“But we must be organised as a people as we\\r\\nnegotiate.', 'The mistake we made before was going to Ruto without our own party.”\\xa0The leaders also criticised the government’s labour\\r\\nmigration programme, alleging that thousands of young Kenyans had been misled\\r\\nabout opportunities abroad.', '“Ruto came and lied to us.', 'He lied to 200,000 children and\\r\\ntook them to Russia,” Gachagua claimed.', '“We want to tell Ruto, bring those\\r\\nchildren back home.”\\xa0They vowed to use the ballot to hold the President\\r\\naccountable, insisting voters would prove their resolve in the next election.', '“He is saying we are stupid,” Gachagua said.', \"“We will show\\r\\nhim on August 10, 2027, when the votes are counted.”Related ArticlesTable your agenda, ’27 will be battle of ideas, Ruto tells oppositionPresident calls for a more substantive national political debate2d agoLUKE AWICHNewsAJUOK: How
